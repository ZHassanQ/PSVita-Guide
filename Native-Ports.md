# Native Ports

This is the **"Native-Ports.md"** file contains the best ports i suggest and how to install them. If you want them all easily go to this **[section.]()**


## Prerequisites

To play these ports you will need these plugins. As said from the official porters.

1. Copy **[kubridge.skprx]()** to `ux0:tai` folder, add **"kubridge.skprx"** into your `ux0:tai/"config.txt"` file under **"• KERNEL"** section.
2. Copy **[fd_fix.skprx]()** to `ux0:tai` folder, add **"fd_fix.skprx"** into your `ux0:tai/"config.txt"` file under **"• KERNEL"** section.
- **"fd_fix.skprx"** plugin isn't required if you installed **"repatch"** plugin.

### Installed (ux0:)

```

• KERNEL

ux0:tai/kubridge.skprx
ux0:tai/fd_fix.skprx

```

## Optional

If you want more performance then use these two plugins: 

- **[NoCapUnlocker](https://github.com/GrapheneCt/CapUnlocker)** Unlocks some non-game capabilities for PS Vita homebrew apps. (**[Guide]()**)
- **[PSVshell](https://github.com/Electry/PSVshell)** Yet another overclocking plugin. (**[Guide]()**)
