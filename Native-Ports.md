## Prerequisites

### Shader Compiler (libshacccg)

The legal shader compiler **(libshaccg.suprx)** helps to make the developers, porters, or anyone who wants to make anything to PSVita easily to develop, ports a game or app to PSVita. 

1. Download and install this app called **[PIB-Configuration-Tool]()** to your PSVita. (Developed by **[SonicMastr](https://github.com/SonicMastr/)**)
2. Launch and press the Select button.

### Plugins

And also you to play these ports you will need these **[plugin](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge)-[s.](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/FdFix)** As said from the official porters. (These plugins aren't included in AIO pack)

1. Copy **[kubridge.skprx]()** to `ux0:tai` folder, add **"kubridge.skprx"** into your `ux0:tai/"config.txt"` file under **"• KERNEL"** section.
2. Copy **[fd_fix.skprx]()** to `ux0:tai` folder, add **"fd_fix.skprx"** into your `ux0:tai/"config.txt"` file under **"• KERNEL"** section.
