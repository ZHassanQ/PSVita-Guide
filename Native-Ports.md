3. Install this **[VPK file.](https://github.com/ZHassanQ/Vita-Guide/releases/download/Assets/GTASA_v2.1_PCAE.vpk)** over the one you installed.

### Notes

1. After fully installing the port, you'll be able to configure it with the Configurator app. The Configurator app will allow users to enable or disable a set of optimizations, patches and renderer alterations to best match users taste. You can launch the Configurator app by clicking on the Configuration button located on the LiveArea section.

2. In order to reduce occasional stutters in-game, delete both `ux0:data/gtasa/scache_small_low.txt` file and `ux0:data/gtasa/scache_small.txt` file, then create a copy of the `ux0:data/gtasa/scache.txt` file to have two version of it. (for example **"scache(1).txt"** so in the end you end up with both **"scache.txt"** and **"scache(1).txt"** inside the `ux0:data/gtasa/` folder), then rename **"scache.txt"** to **"scache_small.txt"** and "**scache(1).txt"** to **"scache_small_low.txt"** . This will however make the loading screen longer since it needs to compile more shaders ahead.
- If the folder `ux0:data/gtasa/cache` contains much more than 300 files, it's recommended to delete the folder and have it rebuilt.
3. You can input PC cheats by pressing L + SELECT to open the on-screen keyboard. See **[CHEATS.md](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/gtasa_vita/blob/master/CHEATS.md)** for available and unavailable cheats (you can input cheat codes in lowercase as well as uppercase).
- The L2/R2 buttons are mapped to the rear touchpad on the top and the L3/R3 buttons are mapped to the front touchpad on the bottom. With v1.2 and higher, you can map L2/R2 to the front touchpad on the top.
- You can open the map by holding START and then releasing.
- You can get local freeroam coop and rampages working by replacing the main scripts with those of the PS3 version. See **[COOP.md.](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/gtasa_vita/blob/master/COOP.md)**
- Due to expired licensing, some songs were cut from the game. See **[MUSIC.md](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/gtasa_vita/blob/master/MUSIC..md)** for a list of removed tracks and a guide on how to restore them.
- To properly take off during Learning to Fly mission, retract your landing gear by pressing RIGHT.


## Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, III

I can't provide any instructions on how to install either Vice City or III as their ports were decomplation of the PlayStation 2 version that was considered illegal by Take-Two Interactive company. And the original source was taken down due to DMCA. I can only provide mods that enhances the graphics and the look of the game to experience the game as if it was the Definitive Edition. The mods were made by **[PGTeam.](https://pgtmp.gitbook.io/pgbook_eng/)** This **[reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/10j2erj/latest_backups_of_re3vita_14_revcvita_11_and/)** might help.
